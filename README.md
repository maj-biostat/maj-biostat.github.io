## Create new post

Copy an existing post out of the notebooks folder then remove the contents bar the yaml and start with the entry.
Render the site then commit and push the content (including the docs folder which contains the rendered site).
The post will be picked up by the listing setup in the main landing page (`index.qmd`).
